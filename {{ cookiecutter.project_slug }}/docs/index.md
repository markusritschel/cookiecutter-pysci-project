## Getting Started

### Installation

For getting started in the fastest way possible, there are *Make* targets provided.
To set up the project, simply run the following commands from the main directory:

First, run

```bash
make conda-env
# or alternatively
make install-requirements
```

to install the required packages either via `conda` or `pip`, followed by

```bash
make src-available
```

to make the project's routines (located in `src`) available for import.

### Test code

You can run

```bash
make tests
```

to run the tests via `pytest`.

### Make data available

You may need to make data available under `data`.
These can be either copied directly into the directory or, if the files are too big and/or already reside somewhere your machine can access it directly, create links in `data`, pointing to the actual location of the data.

You should now be set to proceed with executing the scripts and notebooks. ðŸš€
