# Some stuff for demonstration purposes

Here's some stuff for demonstration purposes.
For more information, visit https://jupyterbook.org/.

## Bibliography test

This is to demonstrate the bibliography feature.
We cite a few entries from the `references.bib` file, such as {cite}`knuth:1986,knuth:1984` and {cite}`mittelbach:2004`.
You can hover the links to see the details, and a click will bring you to the [bibliography](bibliography.md).

## Math

You can even write math blocks in $\LaTeX$

```{math}
:label: my-math-ref
w_{t+1} = (1 + r_{t+1}) s(w_t) + y_{t+1}
```

and even reference them in your text (see Equation {eq}`my-math-ref`).
