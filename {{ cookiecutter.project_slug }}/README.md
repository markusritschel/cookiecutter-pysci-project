## Preparation

### Cloning the project to your local machine

To reproduce the project, clone this repository on your machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/{{ cookiecutter.github_username }}/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}
```

### Setup

For getting started in the fastest way possible, there are Make targets provided.
So, to set up the project, simply run the following commands from the main directory:

First, run

```bash
make conda-env
# or alternatively
make install-requirements
```

to install the required packages either via `conda` or `pip`.

> ![!NOTE]
> I recommend that you use [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (or, for higher performance, [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/)) as a package manager.

Then, — make sure you have activated the virtual environment — run

```bash
make src-available
```

to make the project's routines (located in `src`) available for import.

Finally, you can run

```bash
make tests
make documentation
```

to run the tests via `pytest` and build the documentation located in `docs`.
The latter will create an HTML-rendered version of the documentation in `docs/_build/html/`.

> [!NOTE]
> If you experience that something is not working (e.g. creating the documentation via `make documentation`) try to perform an update via `mamba update --all`. This might solve the problem.

### Make data available

Next, make the data available or accessible under `data/` (see project structure below and details in the documentation).
If the project is dealing with large amounts of data that reside somewhere outside your home directory,
I would suggest that you link the respective subdirectories inside `data/`.
The Python scripts should be able to follow symlinks.

<!-- If all is set up, you can run `make test-structure` to perform some tests before starting running the scripts or Jupyter notebooks in the respective directories. -->

<u>A recommendation for long-running tasks:</u><br>
Some tasks like data processing will need a long time.
It is highly recommended that you use a detachable terminal environment like `screen` or [`tmux`](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki).
This way you can detach from the session (even close your terminal) without losing or ending the process.
Alternatively, if you work on a high-performance computer, make use of the queuing system to submit jobs.

    │   │                     The sub-directories can be links to the actual location of your data.
    │   │                     However, they should never be under version control! (-> .gitignore)

    │                         This should contain only documentation of the code and the assets.
