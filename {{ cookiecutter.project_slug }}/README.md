## Preparation
To reproduce the project, clone this repository on your machine
```bash
git clone https://github.com/{{ cookiecutter.github_username }}/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}
```
As a next step, although optional, I'd highly recommended that you create a new virtual environment (e.g. `conda create -n <whatever-name>`). <br>
> **Note**:
> I recommend that you use [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) as a package manager. For performance boost, I would even recommend using [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/).

### Installing requirements
Then, in the new, cloned directory (`cd {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/`) run either
```
python setup.py install
```
to make the source code in `src` as a package available. If you intend to make changes to the code and want them reflected in the installed instance, replace the `install` in the previous command with `develop`. \
[See [here](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html) for an explanation]

Now, install all the packages that the project's code depends on:
```
mamba install --file requirements.txt
```

### Make raw data available
Next, make the raw data available or accessible under `data/` (see project structure below).
If the project is dealing with large amounts of data that reside somewhere outside your home directory,
I would suggest that you link the respective subdirectories inside `data/` accordingly.
The python scripts should be able to follow symlinks.

<!-- If all is set up, you can run `make test_structure` to perform some tests before starting running the scripts or Jupyter notebooks in the respective directories. -->


## High-level & Low-level Code
All _high-level_ code (i.e. the code that the user is directly interacting with) resides in the `scripts/` and the `notebooks/` directory.
High-level code is, for example, code that produces a figure, a report, or similar.\
Both the scripts and the notebooks should be named in a self-explanatory way that indicates their order of execution and their purpose.

Code residing in `src/` is _exclusively_ source code or _low-level_ code and is not actively executed.
<!-- For standard tasks, you might find respective commands in the Makefile. Just type `make` to see a list of available commands. -->

<u>A recommendation for long-running tasks:</u><br>
Some tasks like data processing will need a long time. 
It is highly recommended that you use a detachable terminal environment like `screen` or [`tmux`](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki).
This way you can detach from the session (even close your terminal) without losing or ending the process.


## Testing
To test your code, run `make tests` in the root directory.
This will execute both the unit tests and docstring examples using `pytest`.

<!-- Run `make coverage` to generate a test coverage report and `make lint` to check code style consistency. -->
