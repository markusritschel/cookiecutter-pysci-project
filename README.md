> **This template has moved from Cookiecutter to [Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io).**
> The repository keeps its name, but projects are now generated with `copier copy` (see [🚀 Get started](#-get-started)) and updated with `copier update` instead of `cruft update` ([why?](docs/tips.md#why-copier-instead-of-cookiecutter-and-cruft)).
>
> Already have a project generated with the old cookiecutter/cruft version? [`scripts/migrate_cookiecutter_to_copier.py`](scripts/migrate_cookiecutter_to_copier.py) bootstraps the `.copier-answers.yml` for you — see [Migrating an existing cookiecutter/cruft project](docs/tips.md#migrating-an-existing-cookiecuttercruft-project-to-copier) (or the [rendered version of the docs](https://markusritschel.github.io/cookiecutter-pyproject/tips/#migrating-an-existing-cookiecuttercruft-project-to-copier)).

> 👉 If you're tired of setting up the same directory and file structure for your new Python projects again and again, then this might be for you ;-)

This repository provides a "template" of a directory structure for small to medium-sized (scientific) projects, making use of [copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io), a templating engine for project structures.
Check out the links at the [bottom of the page](#sources-of-inspiration) to create your own template or use this one to start your project.
Also, feel free to fork the repository and adjust it to your own needs.

## Copier as your productivity booster

By running *copier* with this repository, a new directory will be created with a pre-defined structure and some default files, making you all set to start a new Python project. 
No need to manually create the same files and directory structure over and over again.
This includes

- code that is importable from every place in your environment
- automatically resolved paths to the project's root and the directories for data, plots, logs, etc.
- commands to run automated unit tests, create documentation of your code, etc.
- creating a nice HTML representation of your project's documentation, including Jupyter notebooks, docstrings, etc.
- and so on... 🚀

<!-- It is indeed so easy:<br />
![copier](assets/copier.gif) -->


## Usage
### ✅ Requirements

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
  <details><summary>For first time use</summary>
  If you use git it for the first time on your machine, make sure to set your global configuration:

  ```text
  $ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
  $ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
  ```
  
  </details>
- [just](https://just.systems/) (optional but recommended)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) account (optional)


### 🚀 Get started
The easiest way to get started is using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
Make sure you have `uv` installed, and then run the following command to create a new project from this template:
```bash
$ uvx --with jinja2-time copier copy gh:markusritschel/cookiecutter-pyproject my-project
```
This creates the project in a new `my-project/` directory (replace `my-project` with the path you want).

<details>
<summary>Alternatively, without uv</summary>

install [copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io) and the `jinja2-time` extension via pip or conda, and then run the following command to create a new project from this template:
```bash
$ pip install copier jinja2-time
$ copier copy gh:markusritschel/cookiecutter-pyproject my-project
```

</details><br />

<!-- Alternative URIs:
$ copier copy https://github.com/markusritschel/cookiecutter-pyproject.git my-project
$ copier copy git+ssh://git@github.com/markusritschel/cookiecutter-pyproject.git my-project
-->

Once you have answered the questions, your directory structure will be created and you're set, ready to start working on your new project 🚀.

> [!TIP]
> For further information, see also the README of your new project.
> You may also want to check out the justfile targets (simply type `just` in your terminal to get a command overview).
> Also see the next section


## Features

This is a boilerplate for Python projects – both for package development and (scientific) data projects.
It comes with a set of tools supportingyou r development workflow.
It also provides an optional structure for research projects (see corresponding section below and the documentation for details).


### 🔧 Tools

| Purpose               | Tool           | Comment                                                           |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dependency management | *uv*           | A modern and blazingly fast dependency manager for Python         |
| Version control       | *Git*          | A popular version control system (VCS), automatically initialized |
| Documentation         | *Sphinx*       | A popular and versatile docs generator for Python                 |
| Code quality          | *Ruff*         | A fast linter and code formatter for Python                       |

| Git hooks             | *pre-commit*   | Automatically enforces checks (e.g. lockfile sync) before commits |
| Task automation       | *Just*         | A modern taskrunner, simplifying your workflow                    |
| Test Github Actions   | *Act*          | A tool to run GitHub Actions locally                              |




### 🚀 Just run(s) your tasks
[just](https://just.systems/) is a modern taskrunner alternative to Make.
It can help you keep your workflow clean, simple, memorable, and reproducable.
You can add complex commands such as
```bash
python scripts/raw_data_processing.py -i data/input_data.csv --clean-data --pre-process-data -o data/output.csv
```
to your justfile
```yaml
# Process raw data
process-raw-data:
  python scripts/raw_data_processing.py -i data/input_data.csv --clean-data --pre-process-data -o data/output.csv
```
and then simply run `just process-raw-data` to execute the command.

For more available commands, simply execute `just` in your terminal in your newly created project.

👉 Check out the corresponding page in the documentation.


### 📓 Documentation
The template ships with a Sphinx-powered documentation setup.
Write your documentation in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), paired with the flexibility and customizability of Sphinx.
For example, use reference to literature, parse your docstrings, cross-link your own and third-party API, even from within your docstrings.

👉 Check out the corresponding page in the documentation.

### 📂 Directory structure
<!-- Some tips and thoughts regarding the code layout -->
The project follows a *src* layout, which means that the package's source code resides in a subdirectory of *src*.
This follows the [Good Integration Practices from pytest.org](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/goodpractices.html#choosing-a-test-layout-import-rules) and is a common and recommended layout for Python project;
it helps avoid issues with imports and ensures that the installed version of the package is always used during development and testing.
<!-- If the package's source code would exist in a direct subdirectory of the root directory, import statements like 
```python
import mypackage
```
would refer to the subdirectory instead of the installed version. -->
