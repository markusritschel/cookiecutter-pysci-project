_A CookieCutter Template for Scientific Python Projects_

## Setup
This [CookieCutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) template is a boilerplate for scientific projects based on Python.

## Installation
First, install [CookieCutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) via pip or conda.
```bash
$ pip install -U cookiecutter
$ conda install -c conda-forge cookiecutter
```

## Usage
After installing cookiecutter, create a new cookiecutter from this template by executing one of the following commands:
```bash
$ cookiecutter gh:markusritschel/cookiecutter-python-sci-project
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/markusritschel/cookiecutter-python-sci-project.git
$ cookiecutter git+https://github.com/markusritschel/cookiecutter-python-sci-project
$ cookiecutter git+ssh://git@github.com/markusritschel/cookiecutter-python-sci-project.git
```
The script will ask you some questions based on the entries in the `cookiecutter.json` and will then create a new project based on this template with the information you have just given by answering the questions.
